		<p>You have 6 dice, each with different sides. Respectively, they have 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sides. Your job is to get a pair of dice to match. If they do, you may remove them from the game. Three of a kind results in the loss of a turn with no dice removed. Your goal is to remove all of your dice in as few rolls as possible.</p>
